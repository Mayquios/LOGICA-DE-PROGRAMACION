# 2. Add Two Numbers

 [Spanish](https://github.com/Mayquios/Logica-de-Programacion/blob/master/1%20-%20LEETCODE/05%20-%20ALL%20TOPICS/Problemas%20I/E0002-Add_Two_Numbers/Problema0000es.md)

**difficulty:** Medium

You are given two **non-empty** linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in **reverse order**, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.


- **Example 1:**
```bash
Input: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]
Output: [7,0,8]
Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.
```

- **Example 2:**
```bash
Input: l1 = [0], l2 = [0]
Output: [0]
```

- **Example 3:**
```bash
Input: l1 = [9,9,9,9,9,9,9], l2 = [9,9,9,9]
Output: [8,9,9,9,0,0,0,1]
```

- **Constraints:**
<ul>
 The number of nodes in each linked list is in the range [1, 100].
 <li><code> 0 <= Node.val <= 9 </code></li>
 It is guaranteed that the list represents a number that does not have leading zeros.
</ul>
